        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

This fact is very important to note since the growth of any eCommerce business is driven by one fundamental thing &quot;traffic&quot;. In the world of eCommerce it is true to keep an eye on metrics such as conversion rate etc, but in order to start measuring all those metrics you need to pour in the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the eCommerce industry experienced a rocket flight growth, attaining an exponential increase of 17%. The top eCommerce companies are making a monthly revenue of $600,000 approximately, with the average eCommerce company generating about $1.1 million/month in its 3rd year. Experts have estimated that eCommerce will make over $370 billion/year in revenue in 2017, $170 billion more than what it made in 2014 ($220 billion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although eCommerce traffic is still dominated by organic search, social media had a significant part to play in the rise of the eCommerce industry. In 2014, the top 500 retailers earned about $3.3 billion from social shopping which is a 26% increase from 2013. Social media platforms have undertaken new directives like the introduction of buy buttons that has optimzed them for eCommerce marketing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first quarters of 2014 - 2015, social media bumped up its share of eCommerce referrals to 200%. The dominating social commerce power house, Facebook, continues to show impressive social commerce statistics. Facebook accounts for over 50% of social referrals and 65% of social revenue. Pinterest is also a major social commerce contributor. It generated 16% of social revenue despite an audience of 6.5 times smaller than twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand how social media is contributing to the eCommerce industry, Shopify analysed 37 million social visits that led to 529,000 orders. Facebook dominated as a source of traffic and sales with an average of 85% of orders on Shopify coming from Facebook withng the social category&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform that pulled a surprise was Polyvore, which generated the highest average order value. Also instagram generated higher average oders than Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.
Facebook has the highest conversion rate of 1.85% on shopify. It is no doubt that social media plays an important role in eCommerce and contributes to the revenue generation of the industry hence, eCommerce businesses and merchants should be able  &lt;a target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://cocktailinsights.com/&quot;&gt;measure the ROI of the scoal media efforts&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://cocktailinsights.com/&quot;&gt; manage social media accounts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocktailinsights.com/&quot;&gt;identify best perfoming channels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its no doubt that the eCommerce industry has seen an impresive growth over the past 4 years. For now all the trends and statistics show that it is not slowing down anytime soon and it has its focus aimed for the stars.
One can say the recent rise of the eCommerce industry can be attributed to the increased number of tech savvy consumers, rise of smartphones, beter logistics, emerging new markets and last but not the least, social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We dont have a choice on whether we DO social media, the question is how well we DO it&quot; - Erik Qualman&lt;/blockquote&gt;
